  ## Installation
     What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
  ## Usage
     Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.To add a screenshot, create an assets/images folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README 
  ## Credits
     List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles. If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section. If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
  ## Licence
     The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use https://choosealicense.com/
  ## Badges
     Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by shields.io.
  ## Features
     If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called 'Features' and listing them there.
  ## Contributing
     If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The Contributor Covenant is an industry standard, but you can always write your own
  ## Test
     Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
